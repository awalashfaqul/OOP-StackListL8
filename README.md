# OOP-StackListL8

# About the task

This lab is about using two common generic types in C#. The assignment is create a class and object based on that class which can be then managed through Stack and List.

# What has been done

## Part 1 – Stack

- [ ] Created a class called `Employee`
     - [ ] This class has several properties: Id, Name, Gender, Salary.
- [ ] Created a Stack of objects:
     - [ ] In the `Main()` method, create five objects of the class with different Id, Name, Gender and Salary.
     - [ ] Then created a `Stack` and added the five objects with `Push()`.
- [ ] Printed all objects in the stack:
     - [ ] Printed all objects in Stack.
     - [ ] After each row or element, printed how many items are left on the stack.
- [ ] Get all objects using the Pop method:
     - [ ] Get all objects in the stack through the `POP()` method and print them.
     - [ ] After each row or element, printed how many items are left on the stack.
     - [ ] Added all objects again through the `Push()-` method.
- [ ] Get object using Peek method:
     - [ ] Retrieved two objects using the `Peek()-` method.
     - [ ] After each row or element, printed how many items are left on the stack.
- [ ] Checked whether object number 3 is in the stack or not and print the result.

## Part 2 – List

- [ ] Created a List
- [ ] Put five objects of class `Employee` in the list.
- [ ] Created a condition with the `Contains()-` method to check if a certain item is in the list. If it exists, print "Employee2 object exists in the list" to the console. Otherwise, print "Employee2 object does not exist in the list".
- [ ] Then used the `Find()-`method to find and print the first item in the list that has `Gender = "Male"`.
- [ ] Then used the `FindAll()-` method to find and print all items in the list that have `Gender = "Male"`
- [ ] have also done for the `Gender = "Female"`
